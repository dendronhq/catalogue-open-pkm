<p>Before modern note taking applications were a thing, there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book">commonplace books</a>. These were notebooks people kept of knowledge that they wanted to remember which could include quotations, proverbial wisdom, recipes and anything else the writer fancied</p>
<p>These books were used by both greek philosophers like Seneca to enlightenment luminaries like Locke to make sense of the world. but this was in a time before twitter, computers and the modern age of information abundance. </p>
<p>The label is "information overload" and its why many of us have given up on keeping notes all together. this is why dendron exists - to be your commonplace book, in a world of infinite information, so you can focus and make sense of the things you care about.</p>
