It was developed as a method to grow a knowledge base and produce creative works. The method was pioneered by Niklas Luhmann during his long career as a sociologist. \n\n## Guiding principles\n\nOpen organization rather than structured note-taking. Building a second partner for research. \n\n## Features\n\n### Arbitrary Branching\n\n### Linking\n\nNotes in Zettelkasten are expected to be densely linked. The more densely linked the better really because it helps connect different ideas together to spawn new thoughts and contexts. \n\n### Registers\n\nRegisters are meant to answer the question \"where do I start reading\" when navigating a zettelkasten. They are pointers to the large themes in the zettel. Once an interesting line of thought is identified, you can dive into those group of notes.  \n\n### Accidents are crucial\n\nWorking with a zettelkasten is somewhat like a conversation. You are not expected to have a detailed goal of where you'll end up each time you interact with your notes. By traversing from link to link, down the rabbit hole, your mind is expected to form connections across a diverse range of notes and ideas. Accidental traversals help greatly in finding novel connections. \n\n## Tools\n\nYou will want a tool with the following capabilities:\n\n- Create links between notes.\n- Create notes with static filenames. \n\n# Further Reading\n\n- <https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2QvtE9w5zs49x7WUeG8Ut1vywHDLiG2Wkm9p>\n- <https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/>\n- <https://zettelkasten.de/posts/understanding-hierarchy-translating-folgezettel/>\n- <http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes>\n\n","n":0.068}}},{"i":4,"$":{"0":{"v":"PARA","n":1},"1":{"v":"PARA is described as \"A Universal System for Organizing Digital Information\". PARA stands for **Projects**, **Areas**, **Resources**, and **Archive**, and was was developed by Tiago Forte as an attempt at the \"perfect organizational system\". Forte describes such a system as simple, flexible, modular, actionable, universal, outcome-oriented and oppotunistic.  \n\n### Project\nProjects are short, specific, **goal-oriented** series of tasks that have a clear ending. Examples of projects include finishing a homework assignment, finalizing a report, and giving a presentation. \n\n### Area\nEvery project belongs to a certain Area, which is a larger space of work, with no clear ending. For example, publishing an essay is a project, while Writing is an area. While Area's don't have goals, we can establish **standards** that we seek to maintain. \n \n### Resources\nResources contain the results of research, storing the reference material for projects. These are sorted by topic or themes, and can be thought of as containers to notes on a certain subject of on-going interest.  \n\n### Archive\nThe archive is for items from the above three categories that have become inactive, and no longer need to crowd your working space. \n\nPARA is built for longevity as well as productivity.  By focusing on specific bite-sized projects, we develop a rhythm of work in which we feel we are accomplishing things, which gives us motivation to continue. Similarly, by establishing standards and tracking our performance relative to these standards, we can be aware of our consistency and endurance.  \n\n\n# Resources\n\n- <https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/>\n\n","n":0.064}}},{"i":5,"$":{"0":{"v":"Networked Notes","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"## Summary\n\nNetworked notes organizes notes like a graph with each note having the possibility for one to many connections to any other note. \n\n## Features\n\n![[pkm.ref.feat.bi-directional-links#summary,1:#*]]\n\n![[pkm.ref.feat.graph-view]]\n\n## Getting Started\n\n- TODO\n\n## Tools\n\nNetworked notes are most easily achieved using notes that support [[backlinks|pkm.ref.feat.backlinks]].\n\nSome tools particularly well suited for this:\n\n- [[Roam|pkm.ref.tools.roam]]\n- [[Logseq|pkm.ref.tools.logseq]]\n\n# Resources\n\n","n":0.144}}},{"i":6,"$":{"0":{"v":"Hierarchical Notes","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"## Summary\n\nHierarchical notes is about organizing your notes using hierarchies.

The main features are:\n\n1. **Rapid Logging:** quick, bulleted lists and a lack of full sentences is intended to lower the barrier to taking notes.\n2. **Bullets:** This is the syntax of BuJo.

This is particularly useful for code, ensuring it is portable to different machines.\n\nAdditionally, storing knowledge as plain text ensures that it will be recoverable in the future. Knowledge stored in a proprietary rich text format or as binary is not always recoverable, as it requires a *key*, namely the means of decoding the formatted data. \n\n> `This is an example of Plain Text`  \n\n## Related\n\n- [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text)\n\n","n":0.088}}},{"i":33,"$":{"0":{"v":"Path Traversal","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"Path traversal is a means of looking up a note via its path in a hierarchy\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-cli.gif)\n\n","n":0.25}}},{"i":34,"$":{"0":{"v":"Outlining","n":1},"1":{"v":"Write in bullet points and each bullet point is a page.
