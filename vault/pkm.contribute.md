### Edit this page on Github

Click `Edit this page on github` at the bottom left corner of every page. The only pre-requisite is that you have a [github](https://github.com/) account.

### Clone our github repo

For more involved changes, you can clone our github [repo](https://github.com/dendronhq/catalogue-open-pkm) and opening `dendron.code-workspace` using VSCode.  

## Workflow

1. If you are creating a new page, find the corresponding page [[templates|pkm.templates]] to help you create an outline.
2. Make your change.  
3. Preview your changes using the `Dendron Markdown Enhanced` extension.

### Images

- if you're adding an image along with the documentation, you can [imgur](https://imgur.com/upload) to upload
- note that you'll want to copy the **image link** and not the link to the imgur website
- note before uploading your image consider using a service like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/), this will compress your photos to a more web friendly size.

### GIFS

- uploading gifs is the same process as uploading images
- to create gifs, we recommend using the [Kap](https://getkap.co/) app or making a [Loom video](http://loom.com/)
- if you are making a gif from within vscode, please turn on [screencast mode](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/vs-code-screencast-mode) so we can see what awesome keyboard shortcuts you're using :)
