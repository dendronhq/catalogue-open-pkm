Markdown is a flavor of plain text that allows the expression of formatted text. As opposed to rich text, Markdown expresses the style explicitly using symbols in the stream of text. 

Editors for Markdown can come in multiple varieties. Some editors prefer the "WYSIWYG" ("What You See Is What You Get") style, which converts entered Markdown into its stylized equivalent. Other editors offer one pane for Markdown text, while offering another pane as a preview of the formatted text (like Dendron).
