# Commonplace Books

Before modern note taking applications were a thing, there were [commonplace books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book). These were notebooks people kept of knowledge that they wanted to remember which could include quotations, proverbial wisdom, recipes and anything else the writer fancied

These books were used by both greek philosophers like Seneca to enlightenment luminaries like Locke to make sense of the world. but this was in a time before twitter, computers and the modern age of information abundance. 

The label is "information overload" and its why many of us have given up on keeping notes all together. this is why dendron exists - to be your commonplace book, in a world of infinite information, so you can focus and make sense of the things you care about.
